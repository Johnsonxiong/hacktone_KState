      This is a mobile application named of "Guess my thought" of guessing numbers for party or just for fun with friends which could play by as many as players in only one mobile Android device under offline mode.
      First, it will generate a randam number between 1 to 100. Secondly, the players could input a number according to the hint of range,if he does not input the random number we generate at the beginning, then the range will be shortened and become next hint. At last, the users will pass by the phone and keep inputting the numbers until someone hit the randam number, then he is the "winner" who has to accept the "prize".
      Then the "winner" has two options to accepte the punishment. One is "truth" that will generate a random question that user has to answer the truth. The other one is a random statement called "dare" that user has to follow it. However, if the player does not like the one, he could switch the punishment or return to the above menu.
      This game is easy to learn and play, but you will have a lot fun while guessing the number with your friends. What's more, the best part is that it will generate punishments randomly in an enough punishment library so that you dont need to worry what to punish the "winner" anymore.
      Hope you will enjoy the game.
